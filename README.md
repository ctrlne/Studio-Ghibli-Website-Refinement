### [View the Live Website Here](https://ctrlne.github.io/Studio-Ghibli-Website-Refinement/)

This project is a personal and refined take on the official Studio Ghibli website, built from scratch to be fully responsive and visually immersive. It was created as a front-end development exercise to practice modern web design techniques and animations.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (including animations, parallax scrolling, and flexbox layouts)
* **JavaScript** (for interactive elements and DOM manipulation)
* **Bootstrap** (for the navigation and grid system)
* **GitHub Pages** (for hosting)

## Features
* **Multi-Page Layout:** Separate, detailed pages for the company's history, filmography, and artistic canvas.
* **Immersive Media:** The site heavily features background videos and high-resolution images to capture the Ghibli aesthetic.
* **Interactive Elements:** Includes JavaScript-powered animations, image sliders, and video navigation.
* **Professional File Structure:** All assets (images, videos, CSS) are organized into a clean and maintainable folder structure.
